**Model Summary**

Type of Model: K-Nearest Neighbours (Naive Bayes Algorithm)

Objective: The goal of this model is to predict whether food delivery will be fast or delayed based on features like customer location, restaurant location, weather conditions, traffic conditions, and more. This task is a binary classification problem where the model will predict delivery status: "Fast" or "Delayed."
